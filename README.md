# *Haxx0rn3t!*

*A satirical hacking adventure!*

Haxx0rn3t is:

* Horribly multiplayer

* Chock-full of Hollywood hacking tropes

* Worryingly more complicated than a game should be

Have fun, and enjoy your stay!

## Technical Overview

Haxx0rn3t is broken into three pieces: The central server, the auxiliary servers (for running corporate mainframes), and the client.

## Requirements

All portions will need a reasonably new version of Ruby (at least 1.9).

In addition to the standard Ruby modules (Socket, Thread, Base64, Digest/Sha2, etc), you will need Ruby-Terminfo for the client only.

At present no other modules are needed.
