# *Haxx0rn3t!*

*A satirical hacking adventure!*

Haxx0rn3t is:

* Horribly multiplayer

* Chock-full of Hollywood hacking tropes

* Worryingly more complicated than a game should be

Have fun, and enjoy your stay!

## Technical Overview

## Requirements

All portions will need a reasonably new version of Ruby (at least 1.9).

The client will require Socket and Ruby-Terminfo.

The auxiliary server will require Socket and Thread.

The central server will require Socket, Thread, and Digest/Sha2.
