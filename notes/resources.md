# Resources

Assets == cash

Street cred == XP

Need higher street cred to unlock more challenging missions.

Higher level missions yield more assets and street cred.

Different types of missions lean more towards one than the other. Doing 'hacker friendly' missions (crashing a bank, defacing hacker unfriendly sites?) yield more street cred, doing corporate missions (stealing research data for a different corporation, etc) yield more assets but less street cred.

Normally street cred and assets are rewards for missions, but maybe we want to provide opportunities to get some on the side?

Example:

Crack in to a server for a defacement mission, but realize they have a bunch of corporate data just sitting there. Not part of the mission, and may have additional security safeguards, but you can take it if you want to.
