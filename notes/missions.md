# Mission design

Several options:

* Tutorial level on finding vulns

* File search and destroy

* Stealing research

* Data modification (Corrupting research data, putting backdoors into source)

* Inserting payloads (drive-by website infections)

Side jobs that earn assets but not street cred? Or other way around?

Do we want to allow 'free playing'? In other words, can one play style be to ignore missions altogether, cracking into servers of your choosing and stealing information?

Not until network is much bigger. We can add lots of trivial 'steal file' missions until then.

Do we want "white hat" missions too? This could include:

* Pentesting

* Working on LEA missions to crack into hacker collective servers

* Counter hacking (restoring deleted logs, tracing hackers across the net)

* Surveillance? Cracking into routers to spy on traffic of suspected criminals

We may want to restrict white-hat missions, requiring either no criminal record (come up with a way of tracking that) or enough street cred when you get caught that the LEA tries to recruit you?
