# Mission design

Several options:

* Tutorial level on finding vulns

* File search and destroy

* Stealing research

* Data modification / inserting payloads

Side jobs that earn assets but not street cred? Or other way around?

Do we want to allow 'free playing'? In other words, can one play style to be to ignore missions altogether, cracking into servers of your choosing and stealing information?

Do we want "white hat" missions too? This could include:

* Pentesting

* Working on LEA missions to crack into hacker collective servers

* Counter hacking (restoring deleted logs, tracing hackers across the net)
